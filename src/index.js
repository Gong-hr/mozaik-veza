* The service worker is a web API that helps you cache your assets and other files so that when the user is offline or on slow network,
* he/she can still see results on the screen, as such, it helps you build a better user experience, that's what you should know about
* service worker's for now. It's all about adding offline capabilities to your site.
* React creates a service worker for you without your configuration by default.
